              <p>Welcome to my digital space! I'm an enthusiastic tech student with a deep interest in entrepreneurship. Fueled by an insatiable curiosity for all things tech-related, I am consistently exploring and broadening my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of technology.
    
                Rooted in a profound sense of social responsibility, I approach life with a give-and-take mindset, firmly believing that success is most meaningful when shared. Currently residing in Liberia, this sweet land of liberty has been my home, and it's where I've spent my years thus far.
                
                Embarking on this exciting journey, my goal is to excel and make a positive impact through my endeavors, contributing to a world where technology and humanity harmoniously coexist. I'm delighted to have you scrolling through my site as I share my experiences and aspirations.</p>
            </div>
    
            
              <div class="col-lg-8 pt-4 pt-lg-0 content">

                <p class="fst-italic">
                  Throughout my programming journey, I've cultivated a keen eye for creating catchy GUIs. This passion led me to specialize in languages dedicated to crafting captivating and responsive user interfaces. As I honed my skills, I embarked on a rewarding path that eventually led me to join Spark Solutions as a frontend developer. Here, I apply my expertise to design seamless and visually appealing user experiences, contributing to the dynamic tech environment at Spark Solutions. It's a fulfilling journey where my love for crafting engaging interfaces meets the challenges and opportunities of frontend development.
                  <br>
                  I remebered when I first started signing up for extra curricular online programming courses,my goal was to be good at developing responsive webpages.I took basic programming languages like:<b>HTML,CSS,Java & Javascript</b>.Moving forward,I grew interest in learning some backend languages like <b>python</b> and <b>SQL</b> only for fun.I obviously know that a programmer need to know and understand backend as well as working with and manipulating data  but frontend development is my thing.I realize this early 2023 when I started doing my personal frontend projects.It resonates with my style of bluffing and matching beautiful and apealing color shades.
                  <br>
                  Intrestingly,I built this site using bootstrap framework and four languages:<B>PHP,CSS,HTML <i>and</i> JAVASCRIPT</B>.This is my first web project that I've hosted and it would be updated and modified most times.
                  As new technologies are being developed,it's our responsibility as developers to improve ourselves too. So  for about five months now, I've been  learning <b>React native</b>;the experience is going so well. 
                  <br>
                  In conclusion,being a female in tech feels a little challenging but rewarding if you don't quit!!
